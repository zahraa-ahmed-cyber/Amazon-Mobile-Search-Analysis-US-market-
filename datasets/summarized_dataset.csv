This phone works as stated above. I like it. I switched from android. It’s been a decade since my last iPhone. Thought I’d try it again. Got it for the camera battery life and media capabilities.

"I purchase it because I wanna try new iPhone. when I received, I found there is no sim tray. I was embarrassed because the web site states they will provide 'SIM tray removal tool' and there is no sim tray in the iPhone. it is very inconvenience to me because I have several SIM cards with different countries network and some don't provide esim function.moreover, another inconvenience such be multiscreen. I use Samsung galaxy s21 ultra in pass and multiscreen is one of the important function for searching when I need two browsers in one screen at the same time. I can't believe that iPhone do not support this function but only provide pic-in-pic for YouTube only.screen is beautiful and shape, battery is good and can last for whole day and more, and some apps are good such as to-do list. but that's not enough for me to switch to apple phone.just beware when you purchase",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, 128GB, Deep Purple - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)",I was embarrassed because the web site states they will provide 'SIM tray removal tool' and there is no sim tray in the iPhone. but that's not enough for me to switch to apple phone.just beware when you purchase

Very impressed by Amazon renewed. If you can save a couple bucks by going this route- do it.Mine is basically new.

"Iphone 14 Pro Max, 512 gb.  Unfortunately the Renewed Premium phone I received has a defective microphone.  So I will return it after only having the phone for 10 days.  Other than the faulty microphone I do like the phone overall.Being a Renewed PREMIUM, I expected the phone to be in near perfect condition.  The battery life was still 100 percent and there was a slight scratch on the front glass that was barely noticable.  Other  than the faulty microphone that affected Siri, phone calls , voice memo, speaking texts messages. I was overall happy with the phone.  The advantage of the Renewed PREMIUM is the ability to return the phone after fully becoming aquainted with it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, 128GB, Deep Purple - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)","Iphone 14 Pro Max, 512 gb.

I saved a ton on this refurbished IPhone 14 pro max. Arrived quickly and was as advertised in “excellent “ condition.

"I purchased 2 phones and neither phone worked well. I sent the first phone back because it malfunctioned and received another phone that doesn't work. When charging, the phone does not function at all. It frequently does not work when trying to make calls. It also randomly turns on and off.It's frustrating sending phones back and forth, especially if they're advertised as ""new"" which, I suspect is not true.",1.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy A20 6.4&quot; 32GB GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Android Smartphone (Black),I purchased 2 phones and neither phone worked well.

"I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus.UPDATE: 4/7/2018.  The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer.2nd UPDATE: I didn't  realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely.4th UPDATE April 23, 2018As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy S9+ Factory Unlocked Smartphone 64GB - Coral Blue - US Version [SM-G965UZBAXAA],My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X.

"Long time fan of Samsung products, and the galaxy S9+ does not disappoint.  Ordered an unlocked phone strictly to support drone flying. Understandably sometime when u order phones on Amazon, it can be a crap shoot as to the quality of the phone you receive. The Galaxy S9+ I received was brand new. It even stated brand new on the box, straight from Samsung. And I received the phone 24hrs after placing my order.  I went through the usual setup process, battery charged fine, etc.... For what I paid for the phone, compared to what this phone cost a few years ago, I feel I got the best deal possible for a fraction of the $$$$$.  Can't go wrong with Samsung.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy S9+ Factory Unlocked Smartphone 64GB - Coral Blue - US Version [SM-G965UZBAXAA],"Long time fan of Samsung products, and the galaxy S9+ does not disappoint.

I like the video quality. But camera is not as good as huewei honor 5x. Also i think the s2 was stronger. Like i mustve dropped both phones equally and s2 never cracked on the edges like the s9. I have the s22. The battery on s9 is good. Fingerprint reader was good. I bought it used. Lasted like 2 years. Lots of memory and never ran out. Headphone jack. The glass covering the camera broke easily. I took off the remaining glass.

"I just started using this phone so too early for a definitive review.  I am mainly going to address some issues brought up by others since there are a lot of problems people are writing about.  One of the big issues with these reviews is that people don't usually include who was the actual seller of the product.  As most hopefully realize, just because you buy a product on Amazon doesn't mean it was actually sold by Amazon.  Many third party sellers sell through Amazon.  This is especially a problem for electronics where there are so many variations in model numbers and ""gray market"" devices one could end up with an expensive paper weight.  I suspect that is the source of many of the issues with this product.  Make sure you know the seller.  My invoice shows: ""Sold by: Amazon Services, Inc."" While you may get the correct item from another seller you also could get a lemon without any customer support. Also make sure it specifically states ""New"" if that is what you want and whether a US Warranty (or the correct warranty for your country) is included.  Gray market goods typically don't have a warranty.  Also see if the item comes with Amazon support.  My Galaxy S9 specifically stated 90 day support from Amazon for any issues.I bought the 128 gb version of the S9 to replace a Galaxy S7 Edge.  This is the 4th galaxy device I've had so I am familiar with the setup.  Once the device arrived I turned it on and enabled WiFi to get it up and running as much as possible.  I then used the installed ""Smart Switch"" software from Samsung to transfer everything from my old phone to the new one.  I couldn't get it to work wirelessly but using the cable and included adapter it worked without a hitch.  I then attempted to use the sim card from my old phone to get activated on my existing Sprint account.  The sim card is in a tray at the top edge of the phone.  Use the included tool or paperclip to open the tray.  I was unsuccessful in activating through the phone and online. I called Sprint customer service and they attempted to activate from their end.  That was also unsuccessful.  Likely issue was my old sim card was not compatible. No problem he said just go to a Sprint store and they will get you a new card for about $3.  Next day I did just that.  The woman who helped me was not familiar with the process of someone bringing in their own phone but with help from the supervisor I got the new card and the phone activated in about 15 minutes.  The actual charge: $0!  So the answer to the question do these unlocked phones really work is yes. Just make sure you are getting an authentic model (by buying only from a reputable seller), have a little knowledge and get some help from a knowledgeable cell phone network company employee.Other things to note: the S9 uses a ""type C"" USB cable. This is different from the micro usb cables from the S7 and other models.  It is a different size connector and enables ""fast charging"". One cable is included but you may want to get additional ones for the car or as spares - or get a wireless charging pad. the S9 can use a micro SD card for additional storage.  If your current phone has one you can simply install it in the new phone or buy a new one.Couple additional items of note: the home button is now virtual instead of physical. One of the implications of this is the fingerprint sensor is now on the back near the camera lens. I find this to be awkward especially when operating one handed. UPDATE: after awhile I got used to the fingerprint scanner and now I find it easy to use. However you can use facial and iris recognition instead to unlock the phone. You can also choose not to lock when at a specific location however it hasn't worked for me so far.",4.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy S9+ Factory Unlocked Smartphone 64GB - Coral Blue - US Version [SM-G965UZBAXAA],One of the big issues with these reviews is that people don't usually include who was the actual seller of the product.

"After years of not using Samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, I finally gave it a shot with the S9 Plus. Unfortunately, I had to return the device next day.THE GOOD:Samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. I especially fell in love with the DeX feature. Being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. I first got introduced to this kind of feature on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro (which I also had to return for other reasons). Once I actually got exposed to the DeX, I knew I wanted it in my life.Samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! I doubt I have to say more. :)The camera was ok. For some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL pictures, the ones taken with the Samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. In this days and age, that's nitpicking, I know. All top tier phones take great pictures. It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department.THE ""DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING"":Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. I still don't really care for it but I could at least have lived with it. I hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. For instance WiFi Calling. Why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under Network and Connectivity?Pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. Granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the OS? I know I can disable an app, however, I would prefer if it isn't there in the first place!Samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of Google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. Why do I need a Samsung Clock app that doesn't do any more than the default Android Clock app? Why do I need a Samsung Phone app where the default Android Phone app is just fine? Same goes for Samsung Mail, Samsung Calendar and a bunch more. If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps, I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone.Bixby is a whole other story! From the get-go, I had no intention of using Samsung's assistant. Yet, here she was, right in my face. I could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. I remembered that the Bixby button (which I hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. Yeah, sure! You first have to create a Samsung account, then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button. I don't know who thought of this nonsense!As mentioned, I would have been able to live with the above. Annoying (to me), yes, but I could live with it.THE BAD:The most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. I constantly lost network. Researching this problem online, I learnt that this has been an issue with all of Samsung's high end devices since the Oreo update. The forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. The German Samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the S8, S8+, Note 8, S9 and S9+. This has been going on since February, it seems. Users state that their phones were fine with Android 7.x but since the Oreo update, everything is a mess.Strangely, this also affects WiFi calling, too. I wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. There are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. Samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. Instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. If that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! In between, Samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem.Regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, I returned mine.",3.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy S9+ Factory Unlocked Smartphone 64GB - Coral Blue - US Version [SM-G965UZBAXAA],"It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department.THE ""DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING"":Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot.

"Have had several Samsung devices, starting with the S2. Still have that device and it still works. Keep it as an emergency phone. Also have a Note 4, that still works, although the included software had not been updated so its functioning has been minimized. Samsung hardware has always been a reason why I purchased their phones. Dropped the others countless times with a case on and had no damage, even to the screen.The S9 in black is the phone I chose. It was purchased during the amazon summer Prime Day event for the price of $349. I purchased two. One for my husband and one for myself. So we have had them for several months.The features and functions work well. It is a pretty device, even in black. The fingerprint reader works every time. The face recognition, not so much. I just don't use it. I purchased the unlocked versions. Wanted a Samsung phone that had 600 MHz. The S9s do. We have no problem with it working with our major carrier. The reception does not seem as good as the Note 4, even now when I use the Note 4. Bluetooth is dropped with the galaxy watches at a very close range (30 feet unobstructed). Is it the phone or is it the watch? I haven't tested the bluetooth on another device with the new Active 2 watch yet so cannot speak to that.About two weeks ago, my husband was getting out of our car. The car is low to the ground. He dropped the phone as he was still on the seat with the door open. It dropped from less than 2 feet above the ground. It was in a cover that protects the back and overlapped the edges of the phone. The screen cracked all the way across about an inch down from the top. I was there when it happened. The cost to replace the screen would be nearly as much as we paid for the device ($299). All we could do was be grateful that I didn't pay $700 for the phone.It is still my regular phone. I just like androids. The S9 works with the Dex Stations. I use that feature regularly. It was one other reason I wanted an S9. It attaches to a monitor and you just put your phone in the station and it opens up Dex on your computer monitor. I hate texting so when at my desk, it is very convenient to attach a keyboard and mouse so I can type out my texts. I can also use it to look at the apps and watch faces on a larger monitor. Great feature. Plus amazon has the Dex Stations refurbished for a great price.Now we just don't want to buy another Samsung device and most certainly not a new one, knowing how easily the screens crack from such a short distance, even with a case. So, I am most grateful that amazon had them on Prime day.  The fact that it cracks so easily is a deal killer for a device that is that expensive new. It is disappointing because I had planned on getting a Note 10 as it has a stylus and handwriting texts is really cool.  Now that I know they will break this easily and that is very different from our prior Samsung devices, I am really bummed out. In contrast, I dropped my apple 6S Plus onto rocks while walking with it, at about 3 feet above the ground when dropped, and the screen had a couple of tiny nicks in it. They were barely visible. The S9 should not have broke from less than 2 feet above the ground.I would only recommend this device if you paid under $300 for it, new.",3.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy S9+ Factory Unlocked Smartphone 64GB - Coral Blue - US Version [SM-G965UZBAXAA],"Dropped the others countless times with a case on and had no damage, even to the screen.The S9 in black is the phone I chose.

"December 5th, 2021 @ 10:54 PM CDTAfter jumping through hoops with AT&T's terrible customer service representatives and those reps eventually understanding that I don't want to switch service providers and I don't want to be an AT&T customer they finally directed me to the part of their website that allows their customers to request their phone be unlocked.After AT&T verified the phone was paid for, not stolen, and so on they gave me a code to use during set up with my service provider that did allow me to use my preferred service provider.My mom has been happily using her new Galaxy S9 phone for 1 month. It works great. Genuine new phone look, performance, and battery life. The phone came with all the right accessories in a genuine Samsung Galaxy S9 box.So long story short if you don't have time to jump through hoops for a reset but not service unlocked phone then keep looking.But if you do have the time and patience to deal with that then it is a quality product and I highly recommend purchasing it.------------------------------------------October 25, 2021 @ 11:50 PM CDTSo I bought this phone (Samsung Galaxy S9 - 64GB - Coral Blue).I should also mention that I am already a proud owner of a Samsung Galaxy S9 so I can say that physically this (Amazon) phone feels and looks the same as mine, I bought this phone on Amazon to give to my mom.It does have a valid IMEI number and I got Samsung to verify that the device is a legitimate Samsung phone.Now for the problems it is NOT factory unlocked as advertised and rather it is locked to AT&T. I've put in a request on <https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/> and I should know if it can be unlocked.My concern though is the seller lied about it being factory unlocked so was this phone lost, stolen, has past due balance, some other horrible thing in its past I don't know.------------------------------------------I'll update this review after I hear back from AT&T.But needless to say, if AT&T won't unlock the phone then I'll be returning it to Amazon immediately.------------------------------------------",4.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy S9+ Factory Unlocked Smartphone 64GB - Coral Blue - US Version [SM-G965UZBAXAA],"It works great.

"I stumbled across this in the Amazon Warehouse & couldn't believe the deal! I purchased the Lilac Purple, S9, Factory Unlocked, US Version, 128GB. This phone is in excellent condition & appears brand new! The box did have a tiny bit of damage (paper was pealing on one side), but it came with the manual & all original Samsung extras. I've attached pictures showing the minimal damage to box & excellent condition of the phone. The listed description was ""Condition: Used - Very Good - Minor cosmetic imperfection on top, front or sides of item. Missing manual. Item will come in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.""  What I received was MUCH better!I've had the phone for maybe 3 hours total & am still playing with settings. There are many features I haven't tried yet, such as face recognition. I also can't say how long the battery lasts, but I can say that the high speed charger is super fast. The phone came charged at 50%, & it took maybe 45 minutes to reach full charge. My only complaint so far is the length of time that it took to receive my order. I ordered this phone on April 28 & just received it today, on May 13. Yes; we are in the middle of a pandemic, & I know that everybody is ordering things online which is slowing Amazon down, but 2 weeks felt like a lifetime. This phone was a replacement for my problematic phone & I very badly needed the replacement ASAPPros:* I still can't believe that I got this phone for $280.96!* I LOVE the color!* It's in excellent condition! I'd honestly think it was brand new if I didn't know better.* I love that it has 128GB, with the ability to expand with an extra 140 GB micro SD card.* The camera is such a big improvement over what I had previously. The pictures above were taken with my old cellphone's camera. (The picture of my cat is the one shot I took with my S9).* I love the security features - face recognition, irises, & fingerprints.* The screen is so much nicer, clearer, & pleasant to look at.* It has a nice snappy response.* I love that I can use a wireless charger if I want to.Cons:* It take a long time to get here - stay at home order considered & all.I wanted to post this review to help ease the mind of anyone considering purchasing it, but scared off by the negative reviews.

"Didn't realize no NFC in this version till I got it. Decided to keep anyway because this version has the exynos1330 chip and more ram than the us version.

"This is the phone I really wanted! It has much better specs than the made for USA 64gb model; mainly the Exynos 1330 Chipset and the 128gb of internal storage. Long lasting 5000ma battery. This phone also includes a radio which the USA 64gb model does not. I added a 1tb microsd card for an awesome amount of storage. I also love the fact that it has a 3.5mm headphone jack to which I am able to insert and use a Shure SM58 dynamic microphone for recording videos. In order to use a dynamic microphone with your phone you have to purchase a Startech MUYHSMFF Headset Adapter W/ Microphone and Headphone Splitter. Best to order the Startech from someplace other than here because they sent the wrong cable three times in a row. Special thanks to unitblocks for their review of this particular Samsung A14 5G here on Amazon because the company that is listing the phone, MVD Mobile, has the wrong specs in their listing. Without the review of unitblocks I never would have found this phone here in the USA though I searched the internet extensively for this model which is Model SM-A146M. This model is made for Latin America. When you begin to set-up the phone it is set for Spanish but simply select English United States and you're good to go. Now for sale here on Amazon for $179.00 (as of July 3, 2023). I LOVE THIS PHONE! It has saved me hundreds of dollars over those mid-range phone offerings and provides features that some more expensive phones do not (headphone jack, radio, 128gb internal storage, microsd expansion).",5.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy A14 5G + 4G LTE (128GB + 4GB) Unlocked Worldwide (Only T-Mobile/Mint/Tello USA Market) 1 Year Warranty Latin America 6.6&quot; 50MP Triple Camera + (15W Wall Charger) (Silver),"Special thanks to unitblocks for their review of this particular Samsung A14 5G here on Amazon because the company that is listing the phone, MVD Mobile, has the wrong specs in their listing.

"I'm switching from a Google Pixel back to Samsung because a screen fix shop told me that Pixel screens are the most expensive and most difficult to get. I still think the Pixel is the better phone but I'm so happy that Samsung is finally making a decent phone at a REASONABLE price. Some of us don't have $2000 to spend on a phone! Even if i did, I wouldn't spend that much on a phone. But this phone, so far, is pretty great. It's a little bigger than the Galaxy usually is but I like that.

"Renewed unlocked phone sold by Olympic in Excellent condition.First off, it is in excellent condition. Or close enough for me anyway. The phone looks new except for a small scratch on the back that shouldn't be there, according to Amazon's description of ""Excellent"".  But it was going in a case and like most people I mainly care about the screen, which is scratch-free and looks mint.The phone is unlocked, but it's a Verizon carrier unlocked model SM-G991U, NOT the factory unlocked model SM-G991U1. I asked the seller about this before purchasing, but they didn't respond until a week after I already had the phone. Their late reply was ""This item is fully unlocked to work with all carriers"". It's not an issue with this particular phone, because there were no differences in features from different carriers, but definitely something to be aware of. Ultimately I don't care and had no problem adding a T-Mobile eSIM and it updated with their firmware.This is my second time buying an Amazon Renewed phone. The first time I received a locked phone (from a different seller), but Amazon makes it easy to return for a refund and there's no real risk.

"I love this phone. It's an incredible piece of technology, but, obviously there are a few issues..Pros:  Small form factor, perfect for women's jeans or people who just want a small phone.  Works smoothly. Everything is very fluid and works nicely with its 120hz refresh rate.  256gb. Lots of storage  Back screen. Perfect for checking the time, notifications, changing music, perfect for all your basic needs, as well as being able to take a selfie with the front facing cameras.  Wireless charging/charger. Can wirelessly charge, and can also wirelessly charge other devices.Cons:  Battery life. It's battery life is pretty bad. Under normal use it usually lasts me about 5 ish hours before needing to charge again, but if you're gaming or really using anything on the phone, especially its 120hz refresh rate, expect that to drop down half as long.  The crease. Obviously being a flip phone, there's gonna be a crease down the middle. After about a year of use, the crease has devolped a little crack throughout it.  It tends to get very hot at the top part of the phone when charging, basically forcing you to put a fan in front of it so it doesn't overheat. It's gotten so hot that I can't even touch it without it burning me.This phone has worked well for me throughout the year I've had it. Do I recommend it? Probably not. You'd be better off with the zflip 4 or the new zflip 5.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone US Version Smartphone Flex Mode Intuitive Camera Compact 256GB Storage US Warranty, Phantom Black (Renewed)",Everything is very fluid and works nicely with its 120hz refresh rate.

"Update: I said in my initial review that getting a screenshot is uncomfortable because I need to press the on/off key with the low volume at the same time. However, I discovered yesterday that I can get a screenshot by pressing the on/off button andselecting an option.I am enjoying using this phone. I am happy with the price and the condition of the phone is great. I am still getting used to the slight depression in the mid section of the screen, where the hinge is, but it is not a big deal, I'llget used to it.  I love the colors especially those i selsected for the keyboard. I would have liked more traditional sounds for the calls to select from. The light intensity range is great.One thing I do not like is how to take a screen shot. You have to press on-off button and lower sound button at the same time, which is uncomfortable because these buttons are on the same side.  To press them together at the same time feels acrobatic and weired. May be there is another way,  but I have not discovered it yet.I love the small size but I use the phone as a not flip phone while home to reduce the wear and tare on the middle of the screen as it seems this is the most vulnerable part of the phone.This is the first time I buy a refurbished certified phone and so far so good.

"This is my first time trying any foldable smartphone and I've had it for about a month. I have to say I really enjoy it! The compact design is easy to use one handed and it's an especially stylish and fun conversation starter. Considering all of it's specs, it's basically a mid-ranged phone with a smooth 120hz display. It's everything I personally wanted out of it and the folding functions have been pretty useful for me.The main problem I have with this phone specifically is from the company refurbishing the phone. I received it and it does not open completely. There's a few degrees of an angle that my phone consistently stays at, so I'm afraid the hinge will eventually give out on me just from normal use. It's not a deal breaker, but it's a shame. You get what you paid for I guess.In the future, I plan on getting a z flip 5 or 6 brand new with insurance because I can guarantee my phone will actually last a few years with that.

The phone was supposed to come unlocked and wasn't. We ended up having to call at&t and getting an unlock request code from them. This took us hours and was after the seller telling us to just restart the phone 3 or 4 times and that was supposed to fix the issue but it didn't.

"I’m an iPhone user and was extremely interested in this phone, for all the obvious reasons. So I bit the bullet and bought one. Seller was great, quick and fast shipping (arrived a day early!). I get the phone and it’s in perfect condition - basically brand new. I got the 256 GB version - some other reviews say they got the lower GB. After fiddling with the phone for a little and taking it on a test run for the day, I found that 1. I do not like the androids OS (little too complicated for me I guess) 2. Having to flip it open over and over can get in the way when your hands are full (I didn’t think this would be a problem, however after using it I realized it was). Other than that it’s a great phone. I love the look of it and how you can customize it with themes on the galaxy store. I’m definitely an iPhone user.

 To whoever is reading this know that it is important to indicate the seller that you got your phone from.  I got mine from Toronto Cellular on July 24th of 2021 and so far the experience has been really good the phone is way better than what I was expecting,  It has no signs of use except for a little detail on one of the corners wich i show on the pics   It came into a white Amazon renewed generic box and beside the device, there was a Samsung charger which idk if it is really fast-charging but it surely works very well, also a pinch to take out the SIM cards and a card with the customer service info from toronto cellular.the device is amazing, except for one detail: The 1st month and half using my renewed galaxy note 9 I had signal and everything was fine but after that time, it just stopped getting signal and freezed in a faded blue airplane mode on the tools on the notifications panel.  So because of that I have to carry everywhere 2 phones: my old phone, that I only use for calls and messages and this one for work, media, and social stuff.i tried to fix it by other methods, so the silly me didn't reach to cellular toronto during the 90 days guarantee. and now idk what to do lol.Also I don't know what happened with the shipping because I had to order the phone twice' the 1st time was from another seller and it got canceled. anyway, toronto cellular killed it.regardless everything that i mentioned, i have used the device for 3 months and nowadays works very well, nothing really bothering, you get what you pay for, just make sure u get it from the right seller, take care of it, the water and dust resistance doesn't work (i haven't been very carefull to be honest) remember its more delicate since its renewed, and take the maximum advantage from the 3 month guarantee.also i wanna add that i live in Venezuela, i had to order it to orlando and someone was supposed to bring my purchase to my country but there was a lot of issues and 2 months went by since the package arrived to orlando. At the end i reached out a small courrier that helped me to get my purchase to my actual location. that extra shipping took about 15 days and 25$ but it was pretty cheap comparing to other services like Liberty Express and DHL.the pictures are from almost 3 months since i started using the device and is still amazinnnngggg compared with evetything i mentioned, i really really love this phone. for so many reasons.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung Galaxy Note 9, 128GB, Midnight Black - Unlocked (Renewed)","So because of that I have to carry everywhere 2 phones: my old phone, that I only use for calls and messages and this one for work, media, and social stuff.i tried to fix it by other methods, so the silly me didn't reach to cellular toronto during the 90 days guarantee. anyway, toronto cellular killed it.regardless everything that i mentioned, i have used the device for 3 months and nowadays works very well, nothing really bothering, you get what you pay for, just make sure u get it from the right seller, take care of it, the water and dust resistance doesn't work (i haven't been very carefull to be honest) remember its more delicate since its renewed, and take the maximum advantage from the 3 month guarantee.also i wanna add that i live in Venezuela, i had to order it to orlando and someone was supposed to bring my purchase to my country but there was a lot of issues and 2 months went by since the package arrived to orlando."

"I did a lot of research before buying a phone, and was quite worried that I would get ripped off from purchasing one online. Additionally, I've had poor luck with several of Amazon's third party retailers. With this in mind, I was very skeptical about potential false reviews, false advertising, or a damaged product. However, for the price it was the best deal I could find on a galaxy note 9 outside of a carrier plan. So, after seeing that the item was returnable I gave it a shot. Luckily, it worked. I recieved a fully unlocked note 9 with a charger and instructions on how to activate it.I will say that many of the reviews I read prior to buying insisted otherwise, and they were likely correct. If you're purchasing from Amazon, you'll probably see several similar looking deals with identical display pictures (which isn't a good sign in my book). Even if it is a prime eligible deal be careful and read through the descriptions. Look at the seller information and read the return policies on refurbished phones. It should list something about being returned within 2 weeks of the original purchase. If it does not be skeptical. Also, It should be noted that anyone can make up a business name and description on amazon, then sell used items out of their basement if they wanted, so look carefully through the seller's ""company"" reviews.Furthermore, the charger that came with my purchase was not an original Samsung charger. It was a cheaper off brand model that charged slower by comparison. The phone itself had little to no scratches. These micro scratches are small and only visible after a very close inspection on my part. The battery life on my phone has been excellent! This came as quite a nice surprise. I've used it for several months now and it keeps a charge like new. I can go two full days with mild/moderate use off one charge. ( Mild/moderate meaning not using my phone constantly throughout the day to watch movies, play games, or scroll through social media posts. I may have watched short videos for class, read emails, texts, short calls, etc.)Overall, the phone has worked quite well and continues to do so. Last thing I'll say is I highly reccomend the galaxy note 9 for the specs to cost ratio (as of 2019). Its a good phone for the value, even though phones in general are expensive. Any additional information on the phone specs and relative market comparisons would require another lengthy review, so I won't drag this on any further lol.Hopefully this helped someone and thanks for reading!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung Galaxy Note 9, 128GB, Midnight Black - Unlocked (Renewed)","I did a lot of research before buying a phone, and was quite worried that I would get ripped off from purchasing one online.

"So this phone has many of the same capabilities of an S10+, EXCEPT (the bad):a) lower pixel density. (lower physical resolution)b) no wireless charging.c) has no support for special 'S' line accessories, like S-view or LED covers or closed cover detectiond) quad cameras are great for normal and far (wide), but lacks close up rear-view for zooming in small objects from less than a foot away for details.BUT (the good)…The battery life is better, and will do pretty much the same apps with a unnoticeable difference in performance.Having said that, it's a great phone for most people who don't use any of the things listed.HOWEVER, although the seller is selling these as 'completely unlocked' there's a huge difference.  I had returned the first one I got for an exchange because both the first one and the replacement actually are just unlocked sim, but T-MOBILE locked firmware.Why does this matter?  Because although you can use any SIM in it, many service features don't work with any other carrier… important features like WiFi calling, visual voicemail, no text messaging (but can be fixed by manual APN), AND especially 5G… NOT because the phone can't, but the software is locked to TMobile/Sprint.  And therefore results in 3G like service(worse) if this is not your carrier.  UNLESS you are tech savvy and did what I did, and actually flashed the real unlocked bootloader firmware from Samsung or your service provider, using a dealer (bypass firmware check) version of ODIN.  Otherwise, no amount of troubleshooting or forced OTA (over the air update) push will fix it.  In other words, unless you are going to use the phone on T-Mobile (or Sprint, or their respective pre-paid equivalent), the phone WILL NOT WORK as it should.

"If your price range is a strict ~$200 (""Excellent Condition"" renewed) then this is one of the best options. It's a great phone with a strong processor, feels good in the hand, and a large battery capacity. It looks sleek and definitely won't make you stick out if you care about that. However, this price range is incredibly competitive. For an additional $100 to $150, you can get much better phones (still in ""Excellent Condition"" renewed). However that's 50%+ more of the asked price, which isn't possible for everyone.Make sure the phone comes in the condition you ordered though! My ""Excellent Condition"" came in ""Good Condition"" instead, which made me look for alternative options so I could refund it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung - Galaxy A71 A716U 5G Fully Unlocked 128GB - Prism Cube Black (Renewed),"If your price range is a strict ~$200 (""Excellent Condition"" renewed) then this is one of the best options.

"The actual device itself is pretty good.  Good camera, nice speakers, very nice screen, its quick/responsive...  I love that it has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a MicroSD slot!  It was everything that I wanted/needed on paper.  Plenty of RAM, processing power and onboard storage.And then you get to the actual issue.  The microphone.  Mine simply would not work half of the time.  I would either make a call or receive a call, and the person on the other end of the call could not hear me.  This impacted not just phone calls, but also applications like Teams, Zoom, etc...  This would not be a big issue if it was not my primary device, but it was.The last system update that I got in mid-January sealed the deal...  The microphone 100% stopped working.  No matter what.  I tried changing/adjusting audio settings, rebooting, and even doing a factory wipe...  Nope.  The microphone was 100% non-functional.Sadly this started on day 1 (back in late September) and persisted until that last update in mid-January.  This was extremely frustrating.So, I purchased a replacement phone (Samsung Galaxy A53) and it has been flawless.  Now I have this Xiaomi device that never gets used, and it is long past the time when I can return it.With that, I'll be looking to load a different version of Android onto it, as I have learned that the issue is Xiaomi's version of Android that is the cause.In short, good hardware, bad software.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G + 4G Global Version 128GB ROM + 8GB Unlocked 6.67&quot; 108MP Camera Night Mode (Not Verizon Sprint Boost Cricket Metro At&amp;T) Mobile Cell Phone (Atlantic Blue),"It was everything that I wanted/needed on paper.

"I transitioned from my Galaxy s9 to this unlocked Galaxy Note 9 to my current Verizon carrier without a problem. The transfer between them was seamless. No need to get VZ involved; important to me!! Of course I had to log back in on most the apps which did take a while. I like the larger screen & sPen; big plus for me. The phone looks new. It came with new Samsung charger & cord; both sealed in plastic. I already had a 'key to open the Sim/SD tray, so was easy to put in my original cards from my s9. I had reviewed the newer Samsung phones comparing features & this Note 9 has all the features I've loved on my s9 including the capability to add an SD card. Since I couldn't find this Note 9 on AMZN with 256 or 512g capacity, (in the Lavender color) having the option to insert a SD card was very important to me. Rather than upgrade to one of the newer Samsung phones after reading reviews, I decided this older model has features those newer ones do not. The reviews are very positive for this Note 9. Plus the cost was nearly 1/8th of the new phone cost!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung Galaxy Note 9, 128GB, Lavender Purple - Unlocked (Renewed)","I had reviewed the newer Samsung phones comparing features & this Note 9 has all the features I've loved on my s9 including the capability to add an SD card.

"No incentive to write this review, just wanted to because I myself scan a million reviews before ordering everything.I broke my note 8 that I got for free and didn't want to spend a fortune on a new phone. I first ordered the moto stylus 2021 since its semi comparable and costs less but its way to big for my liking. Then I tried the 2020 version. The size was perfect but there's no notification light (sounds like a stupid gripe but important to me) and a few other things that made me miss my Samsung. I didn't even necessarily need the 9 but for the price why not. I kept the moto 2020 until my renewed Note 9 came in just in case, as I was super nervous about getting a renewed phone but when I tell you this thing looks perfect I mean it. Not a visible scratch on it, front or back. The fingerprint part is slightly and visibly worn but that's it. The phone does get hot sometimes but I can't tell if its any fault to being renewed or just is what it is. The phone is absolutely beautiful, the sound is amazing and a big upgrade from the 8. I got the lavender, which is a different tone from the 8 and I love this color version even more than the last. Shipping was to be between the 15-18 and it came the 15th ..and maybe the best part for me personally was that I was able to transfer everything from one Samsung to the other in 10 minutes with Smart Switch. I was struggling with this part with the other brand and it was essential because of the things I had stored.Would absolutely recommend  ordering from here, and just incase, you have a good return period if anything does go wrong. Make sure you're not ordering renewed from a knock off place..those will probably not offer a return date. Super happy with this phone.

"I bought this phone on August 26, 2020. It's now February 17, 2021, and I have to pay to get it fixed. I paid $416.22 for my phone, now I have to pay another $100+ (depending on what parts need to be replaced) to fix it. I could have bought a new mid-range phone with that money, I didn't, but you can. When I try to charge my phone, a Moisture Detected Error pops up. I've tried almost everything out there that was recommended online to fix it. I've cleaned the charging port, tried a different wall charger and cable, rebooted it, tried charging in safe mode, I've wiped cache partition, almost everything! Except for a factory reset, I refuse to do that, I shouldn't have to do that.When I first received the phone, cosmetically it was fair. It came with that dent/scratch near the pen, it didn't bother me, that's to be expected with a second-hand phone. In retrospect, what I'm about to tell you guys is sketchy and dishonest on their part, but they fooled me, so I guess it's not that big of a deal. Beware of the following. My phone came with a tempered glass screen protector, I thought ""Wow, how nice, they even threw in a screen protector for me!"" Wrong!! Like a month and a half ago, the protector was practically falling off, so I just took it off. And lo and behold, the screen is littered with scratches. You can't tell in the pictures because I already put a new screen protector on it, and like I said, the scratches don't affect the screen quality. But I feel cheated. Performance-wise, then and now, it's great. Some of the reviews on here say, that their phone didn't come fully unlocked, but thankfully, mine did. No problems there.I hope this review helps you make your final decision on whether or not to purchase this phone or any other Renewed device. This is my first time ever purchasing a second-hand electronic device, I always buy new. If you think about it's actually not that bad, $500+ for a flagship device. But, not even 6 months with the phone and I have to pay to get it fixed!!

"I'm not a fan of the 1980 garage door opener size that all modern phones have become.  That's why I've been very curious about the smart flip since its intro.  Finally it's old enough for an Amazon refurb to help with the ridiculous(!) pricing the companies are getting for their new equipment, flip and otherwise. However the phones are still current enough to function properly and act/feel factory new.This phone is literally my most favorite phone I've owned in at least a decade! The screen is crystal clear, the processing is super smooth and it functions flawlessly. The size when folded is just a massive bonus.

"I normally don't write reviews unless they are extremely good or awfully bad. Guess which one this is.The phone (besides being scratched  and having fingernail marks in the screen) was supposed to be in an excellent state. It wasn't. At first, it all seemed good, although pretty weird that it came fully discharged (phones normally come with 50% ish charge). After turning it on and setting it up, the phone seemed to be working fine.Camera was nice and the refresh rate of the screen was as expected. However, as soon as you fold and close the device, it turned itself off. At first I thought maybe the battery was faulty or didn't realize it just got discharged (I didn't use it for a while after the first setup). After this, when testing it out, I realized folding it was the problem, which is ironic because that is its selling feature and what it is supposed to be used like.I'm not sure what failed in the inspection process before reselling this refurbished Z flip 3, but definitely an awful job from whoever was in charge of doing that.I don't think this is an issue with this kind of phones in general, but definitely this seller didn't make sure the quality of the device he/she was selling, therefore my rating is towards this non superised process (once again, it was advertised to be in excellent condition) more than the phone itself.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G Factory Unlocked Android Cell Phone US Version Smartphone Flex Mode Intuitive Camera Compact 128GB Storage US Warranty, Green (Renewed)","After turning it on and setting it up, the phone seemed to be working fine.Camera was nice and the refresh rate of the screen was as expected.

"This is a lovely phone. It was kept on my Amazon watch list for a long time. The price dropped when the Z Flip 4 was due to be released and I finally was able to purchase a refurbished Z Flip 3 in dark green. It was important that the phone easily fit into my pants pocket which can then be zipped closed. My slab phones always fell out. My Z Flip 3 functions properly. The foldable surface is completely unblemished. The camera takes sharp, beautiful pictures. It takes great night-mode pictures of the stars and celestial events. My complaint: When I unpackaged the phone upon delivery, I discovered the exterior front and rear to be covered with numerous shallow scratches. As a refurbished phone, Amazon advertised it as scratch free from a distance of 12 inches.  This is cosmetic and does not affect the function of the phone, and I had purchased a case to protect and cover the phone.

"O celular é incrível, eu realmente amei muito, é extremamente rápido e roda muita coisa que celulares até mais caro não rodam. A câmera dele nem se fala, pega realmente a cor que está no ambiente, para pessoas negras que sempre compram celulares e acham que ele deixa a pele mais branca do que realmente é, já lhes adianto que se querem esse celular pela câmera e estão com medo não precisam ter, ele pega a cor real da pessoa. Para pessoas que querem jogar, saibam que ele não vai rodar no máximo jogos extremamente pesados, mas ele vai rodar até mais do que o prometido pra um celular custo x benefício, joga jogos como Arena Breakout com FPS no 60, COD com resolução alta e tudo isso ainda sem o Game Turbo. Ele é um custo benefício maravilhoso. Recomendo demais comprar e ainda mais com essas loja, o atendimento da Daril Vendas é realmente muito bom, as respostas podem demorar um pouco mas são precisos e ajudam muito. Meu único problema foi que o produto veio com uma falha na bateria, o que é normal, acontece. O celular funciona bem, carrega até que rápido e dura umas horas, porém no meu caso não dura metade do que promete. O que pra mim me incomodou já que comprei pela bateria também. É um erro bobo, a chance de acontecer não era grande mas aconteceu. Posso trocar o celular, mas to tranquilo. Tentei ser o máximo abrangente nessa crítica pra ajudar os clientes. Não fiquem com medo de comprar só porque um veio com um defeito, defeitos acontecem até em lojas físicas. Não aparecem na hora, o importante é saber que a loja está sempre a disposição pra lhe ajudar nesse caso.Mais detalhes:Tempo de entrega: A entra ocorreu 2 dias antes do prometido, chegou em 12 dias.Rastreamento do produto: Como eu comprei em um feriado na sexta, depois sábado e domingo o correio não tava funcionando. Demorou 5 dias para entrar no banco de dados do correio, porém para vocês imagino que em menos de 1 dia já esteja disponível para rastreamento.Jogos testados:Arena Breakout - rodou com perfeição, porém não testei apenas na qualidade alta com taxa da quadros alta também.COD - Rodou tudo no máximo, mas sem o Game Turbo não cravou no 60 Fps.Free Fire - Roda perfeitamente.Sky Filhos da Luz - É um jogo que demanda um aparelho bon pra ter bastante FPS já que o mapa é enorme  e lida com muita ""fumaça"" o que cai o FPS. Porém nesse jogo rodou no máximo com muita fluidez.Velocidade para mexer entre os apps e fluidez: Super rápido. Você clica e ele já abre praticamente, e além de que você faz tudo isso rápido sem o celular das engasgadinhas.Bateria: A minha avaliação nesse ponto vai ser negativa pois veio com defeito, mas 5.000mah promete, e promete muito. E ainda vem com um carregador 33w.Tela: Linda, super colorida e aguenta vídeos de até 2160p60 HDR (O que é realmente muito lindo, e foi o vídeo de maior qualidade que achei, se vai mais eu não sei)Câmera: Tem tanta função que fiquei perdido, vou ficar só no básico. Mas para minha mulher que amou, disse que adorou e que pega acor como realmente é, ela nunca achou um celular que mostrasse a cor real dela, sempre deixava ela mais branca. O video suporta 4k porém pra mim deu uma travada. Tem estabilidade na hora de mexer também, então para pessoas que querem gravar sem ficar tremendo também é bom. Tem camera noturna e zoom até 10x, inteligência Artificial, HDR, Google Lens, camera 0.6x, macro (que é ótima, tirei foto até de uma formiga kkkkk), panorâmica e câmera PRO (aue eu não sei mexer). Tem muito mais, mas eu não entendo de câmeras. Ah, vem com uma configurações ruinzinhas, maquiagens e essas coisas, mas é só desativar. Se vocês estão comprando um celular só pela câmera e estão dispostos a pagar mais, eu não recomendo muito. Mas para pessoas que não tem tanto dinheiro disponível é ótimo. É uma câmera que não vai pegar até os detalhes do seus poros na pele, o ponto mais positivo foi a realidade que ele capta nas fotos. Pelo preço isso é ótimo. Então cuidado, se está comprando só pela câmera não é a melhor escolha.Espero ter saneado a dúvida das pessoas daqui.A minha nota é 5 estrelas, mas vou tentar ser um pouco crítico kkkkk, pois veio com problema na bateria.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Xiaomi M5s 4G LTE GSM (128GB + 6GB) 64MP Quad Camera 6.43&#x27;&#x27; Octa Core (NOT for USA Market) Global Unlocked + (w/Fast 51w Car Charger) (Gray (Global Version)),"A câmera dele nem se fala, pega realmente a cor que está no ambiente, para pessoas negras que sempre compram celulares e acham que ele deixa a pele mais branca do que realmente é, já lhes adianto que se querem esse celular pela câmera e estão com medo não precisam ter, ele pega a cor real da pessoa.

"Sem dúvidas uma ótima aquisição, estou usando a 4 semanas e o aparelho apresenta um excelente desempenho pelo faixa de preço (R$1.100).Pontos positivos:Câmera de 64mp mostrou um desempenho bastante decente para fotos e principalmente vídeos.Processador Helio G95 tem um desempenho ótimo para jogos, rodando títulos como ""Farlight 84, PUBG mobile, Leagues of Legends Wild Rift"" a 60fps estáveis com os gráficos reduzidos, mas podendo aumentar a qualidade gráfica em troca de reduzir a taxa de fps.Carregador de 33w que carrega 20% a cada 10 minutos sendo uma bateria padrão de 5000mAh.Ponto Negativo:O único ponto em que o aparelho deixa a desejar é a taxa de atualização da tela ser somente 60hz, porém é uma tela Amoled de ótima qualidade, a qual me fez escolher este aparelho, pois prefiro ter uma tela que me proporciona melhor qualidade de imagem do que uma tela ""IPS LCD"" com 90hz+ porem apresentamdo qualidade de imagem inferior e descarregando mais rápido o aparelho.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Xiaomi M5s 4G LTE GSM (128GB + 6GB) 64MP Quad Camera 6.43&#x27;&#x27; Octa Core (NOT for USA Market) Global Unlocked + (w/Fast 51w Car Charger) (Gray (Global Version)),"Sem dúvidas uma ótima aquisição, estou usando a 4 semanas e o aparelho apresenta um excelente desempenho pelo faixa de preço (R$1.100).Pontos positivos:Câmera de 64mp mostrou um desempenho bastante decente para fotos e principalmente vídeos.Processador Helio G95 tem um desempenho ótimo para jogos, rodando títulos como ""Farlight 84, PUBG mobile, Leagues of Legends Wild Rift"" a 60fps estáveis com os gráficos reduzidos, mas podendo aumentar a qualidade gráfica em troca de reduzir a taxa de fps.Carregador de 33w que carrega 20% a cada 10 minutos sendo uma bateria padrão de 5000mAh.Ponto Negativo:O único ponto em que o aparelho deixa a desejar é a taxa de atualização da tela ser somente 60hz, porém é uma tela Amoled de ótima qualidade, a qual me fez escolher este aparelho, pois prefiro ter uma tela que me proporciona melhor qualidade de imagem do que uma tela ""IPS LCD"" com 90hz+ porem apresentamdo qualidade de imagem inferior e descarregando mais rápido o aparelho."
"O aparelho é otimo, o fato da digital ser na lateral ja tras uma sensação de diferencial.O reconhecimento facial eu nao recomendo, o próprio aparelho ja diz que uma pessoa muito parecida contigo ou uma foto em tamanho real sua pode desbloquear.

"Realizei a compra de duas unidades, sendo uma para minha esposa e outro pra mim. Gostei muito da performance do celular para minhas atividades básicas diárias. O kit é bem completo, vindo com fonte de energia, cabo USB C, capinha de proteção e uma película simples para utilização inicial. Não sou um usuário muito exigente, e considerei que as configurações e possibilidades sistêmicas excederam minhas espectativas.
